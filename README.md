# IDPAnalysis

## DESCRIPTION

This package is designed to analyze many properties of any protein, but with a special attention to Intinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs). 

## INTRODUCTION

IDPs are a special set of proteins that are characterized for the lack of a stable tertiary structure and very small amount of secondary structure. There are also Intrinsically Disorderen Regions (IDRs) in some sections of ordered proteins. It has been shown that this proteins or regions have very important roles in many proccess, like post-translational modifications, molecules recognitions sites, etc.

Studying this kind of proteins is quite challenging because, due to their lack of secondary and tertiary structure, they behave different that ordered proteins: thay cannot be crystallized, they have a biased aminoacid composition, they tend to evolve quite fast, etc.

For those reasons, this package is developed to analyze many properties of the primary structure of proteins.
